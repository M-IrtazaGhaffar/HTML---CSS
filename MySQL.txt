MySQL is a Software used to manage DataBase (DataBase Management System DBMS)
DataBase is used to store data.

Types of DataBase:
1). Relational Database RDBMS 
	(need SQL language to communicate with DataBase)
	(All of the data is stored in the form of tables)
2). NoSQL
	(it doesnt use table formate)
	(these are document based)

MySQL can be used in any systems like; Windows, LINUX, MacOs.
MySQL is an open source software and it uses RDBMS (table formate).
MySQL uses Table formate (cols -> feilds, rows -> records).

##### Data Types #####
1). Numeric Types (int(must))
2). Date/Time Types (Date -> YYYY-MM-DD)
3). String Types (varchar)


----------Starting----------


1st we will start phpMyAdmin!
In cmd: 
	cd../..
	cd xampp/mysql/bin (because we will do all work in this folder)
	mysql -u root -p -h localhost (-u: username, "root" is by default, -p: password, -h: as we are using localhost)


:::::C.R.U.D system:::::
Create, Read, Update, Delete

(By installing XAMPP, MySQL will automatically install in computer system)


***** How to see DataBases? *****

--In phpMyAdmin (left side)-- or --In cmd: show Databases;)--


***** Creating a DataBase *****

(In navigation bar; SQL section)
Command: create DATABASE DataBaseName;
 
---OR---

In cmd: create database DataBaseName; 


***** Deleting a DataBase *****

(In navigation bar; SQL section)
Command: Drop DATABASE DataBaseName;

(In navigation bar; Operations section)
Command: 

--OR--

In cmd: drop database DataBaseName;


***** Selecting a DataBase to USE *****

In cmd: use DataBaseName;

(If u want to check that which DataBase are u using then)
In cmd: select database();


****** Creating Tables ******

In cmd:
Command: CREATE TABLE TableName
		( col_name  data_type (max-words) not null default "UnNamedUser",
		  col_name  data_type (max-words) not null default "UnNamesdUser"
		);

(If not null is used then it means if any coloumn is displayed empty it will consider it equal to 0).
(If default is used then if user doesnot enter his name then the default username given will be displayed)

In phpMyAdmin (left-side-bar): 
	1). Click on DataBaseName
	2). Create a new table


***** Displaying Tables Names *****

In cmd:
Command: show tables;

In phpMyAdmin (left-side-bar): You can see all of the tables minimized under the DataBaseName.

( If u want to know more about tables then:

In cmd:
Command: decs TableName; , show columns from TableName; 

In phpMyAdmin:
	Select the table and then go the structure (lying on navigation-bar) )


***** Deleting Tables *****

In cmd:
Command: drop table TableName;

In phpMyAdmin:
	Just click on DataBaseName, there tables will be shown...Click on Drop of the TableName and it will be deleted.

***** Altering table name *****

In cmd:
Command: alter table movies rename to movies_db;

***** Inserting into table *****

In cmd:
Command: insert into TableName values( value1_for_col1, value2_for_col2, and so on... )


***** Displaying Table Values *****

In cmd:
Command: select * from TableName;


***** Altering the Cols in Table *****

In cmd:

(for adding a col in table:)
Command: alter table TableName add col_name data_type (value for datatypes);

for (deleting a col in table:)
Command: alter table TableName drop column col_name;


***** Giving a Unique Key *****

(The unique key is like 'id' attribute in HTML because it is totally different for every id, person or anything. If there are 2 Ali in 1 class: Their name can be same,
but their id can't be)

In cmd:
Command: create table TableName (
		Name varchar (30),
		Class int,
		Id int,
		primary key (id) );

(as we can see now that we have made id as a unique key)


***** Auto_Incremeant *****

In cmd:
Command: create table TableName
		( Name varchar (30) not null default "NameNotGiven" ,
		  id int not null auto_increament ,
		  Class int );

(auto_increament will just automatically increase +1 in a number who is given this auto_increament);
(where auto_increment is used there a primary key must be used)


***** Searching in Table *****

In cmd:
Command: select * from TableName where table id = 1 ;

(where command will search in all of the table and will show the records having [ id = 1 ] , we can alse search anything by using where command)


***** Updating a record in the Table *****

In cmd:
Command: update TableName set Age = 25 where Name = "Ali";

(This is how u see that where the name is 'Ali' in the table its Age is set to / update to 25 )


***** Deleting a record *****

In cmd:
Command: delete from TableName where id = 3 ;

(We can see that the the record having an [ id = 3 ] will be deleted)


***** Using Distinct for different unique values *****

(distinct can be used to see the single value that is used multiple times if that value is searched)

In cmd:
Command: select distinct Age from TableName;


***** Order by *****

In cmd:
Command: select * from TableName order by ID ; (default is ascending)
-- OR --
Comand: select * from TableName order by ID desc; (for descending)

(we use order by to make the given list in ascending/descending order)


***** Like Operator in MySQL *****

In cmd:
Command: select * from where Name like '%aza%';

(To use LIKE OPERATOR you just have to enter some spellings in correct order between '%_____%';
(Here, i just give the last spellings in my name and the system gave me the result of my name)

(If u want to search a name i.e it is starting from "i" : select * from TableName where Name like "i%";)
(If u want to seach a name i.e it is ending on "i" ; select * from TableName where Name like "%i";)


***** Functions in MySQL *****

max(ID) is used to find the maximum ID number.
min(ID) is used to find the minimum ID number.
count(ID) is used to count all numbers.
sum(ID) is used to sum all of the ID's i.e. 1+2+3=6.
avg(ID) is used to find the average of all ID's.

In cmd:
Command: select max(ID) from TableName;


***** LOGICAL OPERATORS *****

In cmd:
Command: select * from TableName where ID > 1 and ID < 6;

( < , > , or or || , and or && , between 1 and 6 , ! or not )
